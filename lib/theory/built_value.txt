The built_value package is for defining your own value types. 
The term has a precise meaning, but we use it informally to mean types where equality is based only on value


So built_value basically helps us with 

    1. making our classes immutable
    2. serialization {json and more}
    3. implementing common functions like comparable, hashCode, toString etc.
    4. Allowing us to use Enum Classes
